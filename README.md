This project is my first from scratch HTML and CSS project for TOP.

The project was to make a landing page using thei template, customizing if you want to.

For the main page, I followed their suggested layout and added a lot of gaudy personalizations.

The project technically ended there, but I decided to make single pages so the links actually linked to something.

This is a joke page for my husband's music, with some cult and Jordan Peterson jokes sprinkled in.

This is my very first from scratch project.

I am about 3-4 weeks into learning anything computer related.

I had a ton of fun doing this project and making it purposefully look bad and gaudy. I used a lot of CSS and also used quite a bit of flexbox, which seemed so daunting 2 weeks ago.

I look forward to working with Java!
